# Fair-IRT Framework

## Files and Descriptions

1. **irt.py** and **irt_special.py** are the backbone of the Fair-IRT framework.
   - `irt.py` is used for general settings, i.e., the 2-parameter beta IRT model.
   - `irt_special.py` is used for special settings (Proposition 2 only), i.e., the Rasch beta IRT model.

2. **Adult_STS.ipynb** (with `adult.csv`) and **Law_STS.ipynb** (with `law.csv`) are used for generating the matrix STS.
   - `Adult_Pij.csv` is generated by `Adult_STS.ipynb`.
   - `Law_Pij.csv` is generated by `Law_STS.ipynb`.
